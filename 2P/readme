Encrypts / Decrypts files with a vigenere cypher

After compiling enter 5 arguments:
1) ./crypto
2) "e" for encode or "d" for decode
3) your password
4) input file
5) output file

For example: "./crypto e passw in out" will create an output file encrypt with passowrd "passw"
and "./crypto d passw out newin" will decrypt the output file and create a lowercase duplicate of "in" with file name "newin"
