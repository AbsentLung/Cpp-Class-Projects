In this project I used Kruskal's Algorithm to find a minimum spanding tree given a data file that shows the distance between points.

In order to run, compile by typing "./mynetwork [data file]".

There are three commands, "ping", "ssh", and "exit".
ping - shows the shortest path from current point to specified point
ssh - changes current location and puts new location on top of stack
exit - pops current location off of the stack and leaving previous location at the top of the stack
